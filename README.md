# Steps for performing the Task :-
1. Importing Necessary Libraries
2. Data Pre-Processing and Data Cleaning
3. Data Visualization
4. Label Encoder (For Converting Categorical Data into Numerical)
5. Creating X and Y for Training Data
6. Performed Standard Scalar (To bring the data in the unifrom range)
7. Splitting the data into Training and Validation Testing
8. Building Decision Tree Classifier Model
9. Generate Classifcation report
10. Plot the Decision Tree (webgraphviz.com)
11. Tunning the Decision Tree Model.
12. Predicted the values for Real Testing Data.
